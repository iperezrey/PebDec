En lo relativo a PebDec, David me comentó que hay librerías como scikit-image have the basis image processing tools that we could begin
with but this will most likely be a waste of time. Maybe, just for the purpose of learning. A paper would not get accepted today with just
this methods implemented.

Best best thing to do would be to try CNN (oriented for image segmentation). The architecture of the system would be the following:

Font-end: read the image and turn into a numpy array (maybe converte into grayscale).

Back-end: CNN that takes as input the numpy array.

These are the resources that he sent me and we should look into.

[source code and data from Chen2022](https://zenodo.org/record/5240906#.Y7QkfHaZND9 || This repository contains data sets and model used in the manuscript "CNN for image-based
sediment detection applied to a large terrestrial and airborne dataset" submitted to Earth Surface Dynamics (2021) by Xingyu Chen, Marwan A.

The key task we should search for when trying to find other works is "image segmentation".

Additionally, the color information in the image and consequently the general histogram would not be interesing. Better use grayscale.

Comments on the materiales linked above

I have reviewed scikit-image: it has some interesting operations that we could try such as:

	Histogram matching
	Canny edge detector
	Sobel
	Gamma and log contrast adjustment
	Histogram equalization

Chen2022 introduces a the use of a cnn to measure the sizes of sediment. Their method is based on U-net.
The source code and datasets are in the folders GrainID_ChenX.zip and Data sets.zip.
