En lo relativo a PebDec, David me comentó que hay librerías como scikit-image have the basis image processing tools that we could begin
with but this will most likely be a waste of time. Maybe, just for the purpose of learning. A paper would not get accepted today with just
this methods implemented.

Best best thing to do would be to try CNN (oriented for image segmentation). The architecture of the system would be the following:

Font-end: read the image and turn into a numpy array (maybe converte into grayscale).

Back-end: CNN that takes as input the numpy array.

These are the resources that he sent me and we should look into.

sediment detection applied to a large terrestrial and airborne dataset" submitted to Earth Surface Dynamics (2021) by Xingyu Chen, Marwan A.
Hassan, and Xudong Fu.

The key task we should search for when trying to find other works is "image segmentation".

Additionally, the color information in the image and consequently the general histogram would not be interesing. Better use grayscale.
