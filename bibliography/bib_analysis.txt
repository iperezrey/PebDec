Crida1995: could have some useful ideas for thresholding ans so on...

Dawkins: could be useful.

Latif2022: algorithim 1 -> for grain segmentation: uses histogram equalization which is what I asked ChatGPT about.

Maitre2019: read the first paragraph of section 3 so we can see the level of retrictions for the setting of the pictures.

Niekun: "3. Algorithm Survey" -> important read as it may contain the algorithmic solution to our problem.

Noever: we could use their approach -> labelling the rocks and train + test.

Purington2019: very similar to what we want to. Bilateral filter will probably be key.
