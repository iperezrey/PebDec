The two main are TensorFlow and PyTorch (Keras is within TensorFlow)

Here are the tutorials that I found:

[TensorFlow1] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYj3fFJGjk&list=PLaIF3A2IPm06mzZBHHoojqleokcQkGYal&index=33&t=21709s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

[TensorFlow2] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCFfeUEGs8&ab_channel=DanielBourke)

[PyTorch1] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M&ab_channel=PatrickLoeber)

[PyTorch2] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

[Keras] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFJeN9V1ZsI&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

Based on the info that I could find, TensorFlow is the ideal tool for the development of the second
part of the thesis and PyTorch could be better for computer vision problems.
